# Deep Learning Studies
This repository will show various implementations of DL techniques implemented in TensorFlow 2.0.
## 1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
The first project will be the creation and training of CNN to classify images of the CIFAR 10 dataset.
* A deeper model was used to raise val_accuracy to ~85% after 25 epochs.
* Some data augmentation such as small rotations and zoom-ins raised the accuracy even further.
